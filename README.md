This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool visualization work will go. [Chat with me](mailto:riddhims@andrew.cmu.edu) about anything you like/dislike here! 

# About me
Hello!
Iâ€™m a second-year student in the MSPPM-DA program at Heinz. Prior to this, I worked as a data analyst at Deloitte USI, where I built and migrated data warehouses for clients. The impact of data-driven decision-making inspired me to learn more about analytical tools and methodologies, especially those that create social impact. This passion led me to Heinz. Outside of work, talk to me about food, movies, music, theatre and the outdoors!

# What I hope to learn
- The intuition behind good design thinking. I often don't like my own charts and sometiimes feel lost trying to figure out ways to improve them. Hence, I am most excited to learn the process of how to effectively critique and improve designs.
- Figure out different ways to represent data. I am often stuck using the same charts - histograms, line charts, etc - to communicate my data. Hoping to see a fresh perspective to represent data!
- I'd like to understand how to make my charts communicate across different audiences. Communicating technical and statistical aspects to decision makers is crucial in the field of publictech and something I hope to actively improve during this course.
  
I foresee working as a data professional who analyses and visualises data to help policy makers make key decisions.

One of the first in-class exercies was to identify visualtizations we see in our environment. Now I can't help but think about sankey diagrams when I see trees!
