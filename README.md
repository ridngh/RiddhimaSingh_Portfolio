# About me
Hello!
Iâ€™m a second-year student in the MSPPM-DA program at Heinz. Prior to this, I worked as a data analyst at Deloitte USI, where I built and migrated data warehouses for clients. The impact of data-driven decision-making inspired me to learn more about analytical tools and methodologies, especially those that create social impact. This passion led me to Heinz. Outside of work, talk to me about food, movies, music, theatre and the outdoors!
