# Wireframes / storyboards
The wireframe can be found on the below URL
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/snacking_needs_wireframe/index.html

Since the part 1 submission, the audience of the project has been drilled down to the CMU student associations and aim of the project is to advocate for more vending machines that meet late night snacking needs in accordance to the [Ironviz Prompt](Data Question.pdf).
The wireframe compares the confectionary vs the snack industry, identifies the categories most in demand within the confectionary industry and understands the elasticity of the market for various confectionary categories. 

As advised in the review of part 1, external information sources will be added to project - particularly the demographics of student enrollment within campus across various departments - to understand how well different departments need to be stocked. This data is part of CMU Dash, and approval to receive the data is pending.

# User research 

## Target audience
1. M 64 Urban Planning Professional
2. F 24 Student
3. M 23 Student

## Interview script
**1. Goal: Understanding if the charts are functional**
- What do you understand when you see the charts?
- Has the title made the takeaway clear?
  
**2. Goal: Understanding what other information would users like to see**
- What information do you see missing from the story to convince you we should implement more vending machines?
  
**3. Goal: Understanding what improvements can be made in the design elements**
- What does the color pallete remind you of?
- Looking at the dashboards, was it immediately indicative of the key takeaway or does that need more highlighting?


## Interview findings

**Interview 1**
- The person understood what the charts meant, and said the titles aided their understanding of the key takeaway.
- They said they needed to see more actionable insights - the charts are analyses of the market but there is a disconnect in the story with respect to how they are relevant to the implementation of vending machines on campus.
- The color pallete seemed indicative of yound people to them.
- The title helped them in understanding the key takeaway. However, the key takeaway was not immediately indicated by the charts.

**Interview 2**
- The person understood took time to understand what the charts meant, particularly because they did not understand why the differentiation between revenue and demand is important.
- Since the person was an international student, they were interested to see more than just the US market
- The color pallete reminded them of cotton candy

**Interview 3**
- The person understood what the charts meant, but said the titles needed to be more clear. They could not provide alternative titles.
- The person said while the charts were helpful, the story of connecting it with campus needs was missing. The person was from Tepper, and they did not notice a lack of snacking options. But said they understand if other departments did not have vending machines and hence, the need for this project.


# Identified changes for Part III
- Common problem noticed across all the interviews was a missing connect between the market analysis and campus needs. The next step here would be to get more campus specific data. Hence, I asked the team behind CMU Dash for access to student enrollment and demographic data. Once we have more data, further step would be to try and estimate the potential demand of snacks on campus broken down by demographics and departments.
- The storyboards needs better indicative title. While in this draft, I wanted to test out the visualizations only, it was made clear that the visualizations need background hand in hand. The next step here is to develop the written content to define the problem, interpret the analysis, and give recommendatinons.
- The visuals seemed to be functional, but would benefit from better formatting. The next step here is to clean the titles, make the color palette consistent, and to try and highlight the key takeaways within the chart itself.
